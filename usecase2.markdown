  - quote: "“[Rianne] is highly independent and motivated, formulating and successfully pushing forward the research questions resolved in her thesis. Rianne has a strong intuition in search for relevant problem formulations; she grounds her research approach in the specifics of the application domains.”"

  - quote: "“[Rianne] went far beyond research, supervising student groups and master thesis projects of individual students, teaching lectures and later coordinating an entire track within a master-level course. Rianne obtained quite a bit of funding in NWO and EWUU alliance calls. These would be normal activities for a faculty-level academic career, but when you're still working on your PhD this is quite a bit ahead of the curve.”"
