  - quote: "“[Rianne] is highly independent and motivated, formulating and successfully pushing forward the research questions resolved in her thesis.

  - quote: "“[Rianne] went far beyond research, supervising student groups and master thesis projects of individual students, teaching lectures and later coordinating an entire track within a master-level course. Rianne obtained quite a bit of funding in NWO and EWUU alliance calls. These would be normal activities for a faculty-level academic career, but when you're still working on your PhD this is quite a bit ahead of the curve.”"

      Experience outside academia: 3 years. And as independent statistical consultant. Lots of supervision and teaching, lead successful collaborations (hospitals, public health, educational domain).

      Current: post-doc at TU/e, obtained personal take-off grant (€40K), supervision of 2 PhD candidates, and job searching (academia).Rather than just reporting which answers are wrong, our system uncovers patterns in student mistakes and explains why those errors occur.
