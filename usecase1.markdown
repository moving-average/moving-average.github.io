## Discovering patterns in children's math learning

This research explores how to detect early signs of dyscalculia through smart data analysis.

### Timed math tasks

Each child solves as many problems as possible in 3 minutes. Their response speed and accuracy are key indicators.

### Dot enumeration

Subitizing and counting help us understand cognitive patterns. This is crucial to distinguish between typical development and dyscalculia.

> **Key Insight:**  
> Children with slower dot processing and poor addition skills are highly indicative of dyscalculia.
