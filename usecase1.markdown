  - title: Timed math tasks
    text: Each child solves as many problems as possible in 3 minutes. Their response speed and accuracy are key indicators.
  - title: Dot enumeration
    text: Subitizing and counting help us understand cognitive patterns. This is crucial to distinguish between typical development and dyscalculia.
  - title: Key Insight
    text: Children with slower dot processing and poor addition skills are highly indicative of dyscalculia.

  - quote: "“[Rianne] is highly independent and motivated, formulating and successfully pushing forward the research questions resolved in her thesis. Rianne has a strong intuition in search for relevant problem formulations; she grounds her research approach in the specifics of the application domains.”"

  - quote: "“[Rianne] went far beyond research, supervising student groups and master thesis projects of individual students, teaching lectures and later coordinating an entire track within a master-level course. Rianne obtained quite a bit of funding in NWO and EWUU alliance calls. These would be normal activities for a faculty-level academic career, but when you're still working on your PhD this is quite a bit ahead of the curve.”"
